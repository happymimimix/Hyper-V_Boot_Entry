# Hyper-V_Boot_Entry
This script adds a new entry in Windows Boot Manager for Hyper-V. 

So now you don't have to go into the control panel and completely uninstall Hyper-V every time you want to use any other virtualization software such as VMWare Workstation. 

Just simply choose which mode you want at boot time.
